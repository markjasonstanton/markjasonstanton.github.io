Here I go, here I go, here I go again. Ok then chillin. I built this simple site on [GitHub](http://www.github.com) for the purpose of shameless self-promotion. I installed [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on my high-performance 4 year old macbook air. That was a nightmare. I installed [Ruby](http://rubyonrails.org/). I won't say that was a nightmare, but I'm not super experienced with linux / terminal, so that could be a mess. I setup my [user page on github](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) (I had one from messing around with this in the past, so this wasn't so bad). Then I installed the basic template for a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) using some styles from some guy who goes by the name of Hank Quinlan.

It took me about three hours. This is YUUUGE. Next up: *shameless self promotion!*
